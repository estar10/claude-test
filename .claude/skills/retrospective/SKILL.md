After completing a significant task, run a brief retrospective:

1. **Read the conversation history** -- What was asked? What was delivered?
2. **Evaluate:**
   - Did the solution stay within scope?
   - Were changes small and reversible?
   - Were there any wasted steps or wrong turns?
   - Was anything harder than expected? Why?
3. **Extract insights** -- If there's a reusable lesson, append it to `.claude/lessons.md`.
4. **Report to the user** -- Share a 2-3 sentence summary of what went well and one thing to improve next time.

Keep it honest and brief. The goal is continuous improvement, not ceremony.
